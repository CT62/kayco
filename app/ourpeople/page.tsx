                I am Dr. Lena Kadri, the founder of Kayco. Throughout my career
                in academia and global pharma, I kept seeing the same challenges
                again and again.

                Patients&rsquo; needs left unmet, groups of people forgotten,
                unbearable side effects, and medications that offered little to no
                relief. In some cases, there were no treatment options at all.

                The science was there. But access to meaningful medicine still
                wasn&rsquo;t reaching everyone â€” women, children, people with
                disabilities, the elderly, and those living with rare conditions.
